## Hi 👋 I'm Hira Waheed.

I’m a passionate **Full-Stack Developer** and **AI Enthusiast** with a strong foundation in Python and experience in FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and MERN Stack. I love building robust, scalable systems and crafting user-friendly solutions that solve real-world problems. 💡 
When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring machine learning or diving into prompt engineering to push the boundaries of what AI can do. From creating APIs with seamless user authentication to generating image-based advertisements using AI, I thrive on transforming innovative ideas into impactful projects.

🔭 I’m currently working on developing **AI-based software solutions** through Python <br>
🌱 I’m learning **Large Language Models (LLMs)** <br>
